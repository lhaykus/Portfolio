# Portfolio


This project is my Software Development Portfolio where I will be able to display all my projects that I complete in this bootcamp and on my own to show future employers! Using the knowledge I have gained on HTML I created a webpage that has multiple sections, a sidebar, a hero image as the banner and a gallery of what will soon be my own projects! Adding on to that I used my newly obtained knowledge of CSS to dress up my webpage to make it both professional and creative to match my personality. The "About Me", "My Work", and "Contact Me" tabs are linked to jump to the appropriate sections on the webpage. After researching, I discovered how to put social media icons in HTML so I was able to add my Linkedin and Email for the "Contact Me" section to add some style. Using the row and column feature I was able to create sections to display my future projects in. I then used an avatar for my profile picture (which will be changed when I send this out to employers to be more professional) and images to act as my future projects since at this time I do not have projects to display just yet.
